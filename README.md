## Python-Qestion-And-Solution
Hi everyone, i decided to create or find python qestion and share solve them to github.
if you interesting python or javascript you find question and their solutions this page.
okey lets start.

# Question 1: <br>
It is a matrix question.Your problem is create a spiral matrix. this matrix attiributes are write below: <br>
1-)This matrix maximum number must be equal any integer square. <br>
2-)This matrix must work only odd and positive integer.(positive is optional) <br>
3-)this program take a user input only number. <br>
4-)this program exit key kombination is just ctrl+d. <br>
5-)this program always run.<br>

Describes:<br>
1-)Spiral matrix:The Spiral Matrix problem takes a 2-Dimensional array of N-rows and M-columns as an input, and prints the elements of this matrix in spiral order. The spiral begins at the top left corner of the input matrix, and prints the elements it encounters, while looping towards the center of this matrix, in a clockwise manner.

<br>

#Question 2: <br>
Write a Python program to find the smallest multiple of the m number of random n numbers in list.<br>
easy mod:All number positive normal mod:All integer in Domain hard mode:Domain contains imaginary number very hard mode:Find and .....(kanÄ±tlamak) fastest algorithm.<br>
for example n=4 m=2<br>
ie random list=[5,7,2,3]<br>
result return 2*3=6 and print out:2*3=6<br>
